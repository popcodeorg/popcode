    <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
    <p>This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for <a href="https://popcode.org">Popcode</a>. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website. It will notify you of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the website, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.</li>
      <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
      <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
      <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h2>

    <p>Information about all Popcode users is collected on our behalf by our business partners in order to provide the makers of Popcode with insights into usage of the product. This information is not explicitly linked to an individual user’s identity, but does contain data which might allow a user’s personal identity to be ascertained (e.g. IP address).</p>

    <p>For users who choose to register for accounts on Popcode, we store basic profile information (name, email address) in a database we control. This information is used purely for identifying user accounts. No unsolicited email will ever be sent. This information will under no circumstances ever be shared with a third party. Usage of Popcode does not require creating an account.</p>

    <p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, collecting information about how the site is used). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

    <p>If you contact us regarding a problem with our product, we may access information in your account in order to help you resolve the problem.</p>

    <h2>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h2>
    <p>You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email address given at the bottom of this notice:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>See what data we have about you, if any.</li>
      <li>Change/correct any data we have about you.</li>
      <li>Have us delete any data we have about you.</li>
      <li>Express any concern you have about our use of your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security </h2>

    <p>All first-party data that we retain is stored in a cloud database service operated by Google, a reputable vendor with strong security practices.</p>

    <p>Wherever we collect your information, that information is encrypted and transmitted in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.</p>

    <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only people who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, troubleshooting a bug) are granted access to personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Links</h2>

    <p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

    <p><strong>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email at <a href="mailto:popcode.editor@gmail.com">popcode.editor@gmail.com</a>.</strong></p>
